## 🔧 Required Setup

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Cloudinary Configuration (Required)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

### Cloudinary Account Setup
1. Sign up at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Get your credentials from the dashboard
3. Add them to your `.env` file

## 🚀 How It Works

### New Video Uploads
- Videos are uploaded directly to Cloudinary
- Stored in `screenforge/videos` folder
- Automatic quality optimization
- Global CDN delivery
- Secure URLs with optional expiration

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing local videos continue to work
- System supports both storage types
- Migration script available for moving old videos

### File Organization
```
Cloudinary Structure:
screenforge/
  └── videos/
      ├── {userId}/{videoId}-{timestamp}
      └── migration/{userId}/{videoId} (for migrated videos)
```

## 📝 Benefits

✅ **Scalability** - No server storage limitations
✅ **Performance** - Global CDN delivery
✅ **Reliability** - Automatic backup and redundancy
✅ **Optimization** - Automatic video optimization
✅ **Security** - Secure URLs and access control
✅ **Cost** - No server storage costs

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Set up Cloudinary account** and add credentials to `.env`
2. **Test video uploads** to ensure Cloudinary integration works
3. **Optional**: Run migration script to move existing videos to Cloudinary
4. **Deploy** with new Cloudinary configuration

## 📊 Migration (Optional)

To migrate existing local videos to Cloudinary:

```bash
# Migrate all local videos to Cloudinary
npm run migrate:cloudinary migrate

# Note: Local files are kept for safety
# Delete them manually after verifying migration
```

The system now supports both local and Cloudinary storage, making the transition seamless!
